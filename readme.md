# my tweaks and variations on `xfce4themes`

I like the old school `XFCE` themes but have a few changes to make. 

I am running an older version of `XFCE` and it is my understanding that those running more modern versions will not be able to use these themes either at all or reliably. 

## Breadcrumbs


 * I forked the full collection to [CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes). To avoid duplication and confusion, I am only moving those themes over to here which I am working on. 
 
 * Upstream was [Distrotech/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/Distrotech/xfwm4-themes); it is a mirror of a repo that no longer exists, though it is [archived](https://git.xfce.org/archive/xfwm4-themes).
