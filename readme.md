# my tweaks and variations on `xfce4themes`

I like the old school `XFCE` themes but have a few changes to make. 

I am running an older version of `XFCE` and it is my understanding that those running more modern versions will not be able to use these themes either at all or reliably. 

## Trench-2022

My version of the classic `XFCE` theme `trench`.
Basically, compared to the original:

 * Inactive windows are no longer totally plain, but instead have light lines and action icons which are similar to the active window's titlebar

   * The inactive icons lack shadows present in the active icons; I felt these were too busy. There is a branch where this is available if anyone wants it.

 * Titlebar text slightly adjusted so that it is centred vertically using my font of choice `aqui`

## Breadcrumbs

Where the foundations came from:

 * I forked the full collection to [CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/CouldBeThis/xfwm4-themes). To avoid duplication and confusion, I am only moving those themes over to here which I am working on. 
 
 * Upstream was [Distrotech/xfwm4-themes](https://github.com/Distrotech/xfwm4-themes); it is a mirror of a repo that no longer exists, though it is [archived](https://git.xfce.org/archive/xfwm4-themes). Some [discussion](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1184207/where-can-i-get-xfwm4-themes-on-xubuntu-19-10) of this.
