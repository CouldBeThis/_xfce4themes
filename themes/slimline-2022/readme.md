* I've nicked (but should perhaps have included as a submodule?) many the other contents from [my fork ](https://github.com/CouldBeThis/Solaris-9) of [B00merang-Project/Solaris-9](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Solaris-9) to see about porting the `xfwm4` theme to `gtk3`.
* plan: change the css to accept old icons and maybe write a script to rename those items which could require it.

some work elsewhere:

* [convert `.xpm` images (used in gtk 2 theme)](https://gist.github.com/CouldBeThis/c521b87deaa7af7ff490475f8e8f3046)
* [convert colors from hex to HSL (source = list in text file)](https://gist.github.com/CouldBeThis/e3e6f168a00c92f1ca5dc22d87cbf694)
